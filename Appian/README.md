This is a personal exercise project.(,,• ₃ •,,)
Maybe it's nonsense,
but it may be a significant step to me to be a qualified engineer.

The facts tell me how stupid I am to be at a standstill.
I need to debug myself.(⊙﹏⊙)

Debugging's actually all about finding the bug,
about understanding why the bug was there to begin with,
about knowing that its existence was no accident.

No one like loneliness,just dislike disappointment.
Even thought I am used to be.(,,•́ . •̀,,)
